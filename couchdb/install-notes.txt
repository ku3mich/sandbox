"When you run 2.0 as a single node, it doesnâ€™t create system databases on
startup. You have to do this manually
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_users
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes:
"

Does the setup create those databases or do I have to do it by hand?  I
can't seem to do it by hand without doing the setup, because I get a
{
    "error":"method_not_allowed",
	    "reason":"Only GET,HEAD allowed"
		}
		error that is mentioned here:
		http://couchdb-13.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-basics/
		if I try.
